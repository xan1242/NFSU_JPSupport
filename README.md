# NFS Underground - Japanese Language Support Plugin

This is a simple plugin that allows you to use the v1.4.0 US (and possibly EU) build of NFS Underground with Japanese language files (audio, movies, strings, badges).



Use this in combination with the US v1.4.0 executable to run the Japanese PC build with a NoCD patch properly.

NOTE: This is technically **not** allowing you to run the JP build of the game. It will still be the US build but simply run with the Japanese assets!

## Features

- Remaps all movie files to their correct JP counterparts

- Corrects the hashmap and filename of the Japanese language

- Sets the correct logo and secondary logo for Integra and RSX

- Allows to override the language and build region of the game
